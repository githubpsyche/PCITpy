    "I find a bug in the output of my `compute_weights` function: `p_theta_minus_q_theta` has the wrong shape, 20 x 100k instead of 1 x 100k. Obviously my hope is that this reflects an opportunity to further optimize compute weights, but it's probably a shape issue with a sum I did at some point in the calculation. Once I work that out (on line 131), I'll be able to move forward with my plan to sidestep runtime issues I might face with further code testing."
